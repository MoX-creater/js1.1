# Live Character Counter for Textarea

## 📌 Title  
**Live Character Counter for Textarea**

## 🎯 Objective  
To create a simple feature that displays a **live character count** as the user types in a textarea. This project demonstrates **real-time event handling** and **dynamic DOM updates** using JavaScript.

## 📝 Task Description  
- Build a webpage with a **textarea** where users can type text.  
- Below the textarea, show a **character counter**.  
- The counter updates immediately when the user **types or deletes** content.  
- Provides **instant feedback** on the number of characters entered.  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. The HTML file contains:
   - A `textarea` input area.  
   - A `<p>` element to display the live character count.  
2. JavaScript uses the `input` event listener to track text changes.  
3. As the user types or deletes text, the script updates the counter in real time.  
4. No page reload is needed — updates happen instantly.  

## 📂 Files  
Since everything is in **one file**, only `index.html` is required.
